# [Valentine's Day Surprise Project]() - React Website 

This project is a special Valentine's Day surprise for my girlfriend. It's a React website that showcases 8 images of both of you together. When you click on each image, a textbox appears, revealing your heartfelt feelings and memories associated with that particular picture. It also has a little interactive Cinamoroll ([Sanrio](https://www.sanrio.com/)
 character) that plays her favorite song when clicked.

## Features:

- **Image Rotation:** The website rotates through 8 images of you and your loved one together, creating a nostalgic journey through your memories.
  
- **Interactive Textbox:** Clicking on each image reveals a textbox containing your feelings and memories for that specific picture. It adds a personal touch to each moment captured.

- **Responsive Design:** The website is optimized for both desktop and mobile views, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience across different devices.
